            <p class="lead">Cristiano Ronaldo was born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal. He was the youngest child in the family, having one older brother named Hugo and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia.

              Ronaldo's childhood was marked by a keen interest in football from a very young age. His father, José Dinis Aveiro, was a kit man and equipment manager for a local football club, and this likely influenced Ronaldo's early exposure to the sport. Ronaldo's mother, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, worked as a cook and cleaning lady.
              
              Growing up in a working-class neighborhood, Ronaldo faced economic challenges, but his talent and dedication to football soon became evident. He joined the youth academy of the local club, Andorinha, when he was just eight years old. His skills quickly attracted attention, and he later moved to the youth academy of Sporting Lisbon in mainland Portugal.
              
              At Sporting Lisbon, Ronaldo's talent continued to flourish, catching the eye of Manchester United scouts. In 2003, he made a high-profile transfer to Manchester United in the English Premier League, marking the beginning of his illustrious international football career.
              
              
              
              
              
              
                
                He graduated from School of Performing Arts Seoul, an arts high school, in 2017. In November 2016, he decided to forgo taking the CSATs, Korea's nationwide university entrance exam. In March 2022, he received his degree from Global Cyber University's Department of Broadcasting and Entertainment. He was awarded the President's Award, the school's highest honor.</p>
