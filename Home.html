            <p class="lead">As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Cristiano Ronaldo is a Portuguese professional footballer widely regarded as one of the greatest football players of all time. Born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, Ronaldo began his career with Sporting Lisbon in Portugal before moving to Manchester United in 2003.

              During his time with Manchester United, Ronaldo achieved great success, winning three English Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League in the 2007-2008 season. In 2008, he was awarded the FIFA World Player of the Year.
              
              In 2009, Ronaldo made a high-profile transfer to Real Madrid for what was then a world-record transfer fee. At Real Madrid, he continued to shine, winning numerous domestic and international titles, including four Champions League trophies. Ronaldo became Real Madrid's all-time leading goal scorer and won the FIFA Ballon d'Or (now The Best FIFA Men's Player) award multiple times.
              
              In 2018, Ronaldo transferred to Juventus in Italy's Serie A. He continued to demonstrate his goal-scoring prowess and leadership qualities, contributing significantly to Juventus' success.
              
              It's important to note that player histories can change, and career details may have evolved since my last update in January 2022. Please verify the latest information to ensure accuracy, especially if you are looking for the most recent developments in Cristiano Ronaldo's career.
